# Book-Author management Backend 

This is a simple backend written in NodeJs . This code simply manages a book-author database . Simple CURD endpoints are provided . MongoDB along with Mongoose is used as the database solution . I have used a local
instance of MongoDB . You can use your own MongoDB instance simply by changing the MONGO_URI in the .env file . JWT is used for authorization purposes and Bcrypt is used for storing passwords securely in the database.
fakerjs is used for seeding fake data . I have build the initial thing in 3-4 hours may contain some bugs . feel free to raise an issue 
Contributors are always welcome . feel free to ping me on my email : jtlayan@gmail.com
